Assumptions: 

1.	We have to show all discount amount if total bill > 200 for example
If total bill = 340 then 20% discount, on amount greater than 200 which is = 140 so 20% discount is = 28
And 10% discount on remaining 10% (200) which is = 20
So result should display both discount amount (20% = 28 & 10% = 20) as shown below

Total				    340.0
Discount - 20.0%		28.0
Discount - 10.0%		20.0
Final Amount			292.0
